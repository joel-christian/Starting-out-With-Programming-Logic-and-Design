# CalorieesfromCarbandFat
A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula: Calories from Fat = Fat Grams × 9 Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the following formula: Calories from Carbs = Carb Grams × 4. The nutritionist asks you to design a modular program that will make these calculations and display the total number of Calories at the end.
